# Getting Started With Schematics

This repository is a basic Schematic implementation that serves as a starting point to create and publish Schematics to npm. Read [Use Angular Schematics to Simplify Your Life](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/02/13/angular-schematics) to see how this example was created. You can also [watch a screencast on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ANwZIt3Ni2s).

## Getting Started

Clone this application to your local hard drive using Git.

```
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-angular-schematics-example.git schematics-example
cd schematics-example
npm i
```

### Testing

To test locally, install `@angular-devkit/schematics-cli` globally and use the `schematics` command line tool. That tool acts the same as the `generate` command of the Angular CLI, but also has a debug mode.

Check the documentation with
```bash
schematics --help
```

### Unit Testing

`npm run test` will run the unit tests, using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.

### Publishing

To publish, simply do:

```bash
npm run build
npm publish
```

That's it!
